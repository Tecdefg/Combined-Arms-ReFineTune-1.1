# Combined-Arms-ReFineTune-1.1

New Submod for Combined Arms Released.

Large balance changes changing core gameplay.
More Hull Sizes accessible both from lowered research costs.
More Tech level and Techs reordered in Upgrade Path.
Slightly Better research at start - from capital city and outposts.
Spaceports have 1 slot for fighter. 
Bigger Sensor ranges.
Shields nerfed.
New 2x2 Sensors.
Default gravity well range increased and defence buildings made stronger to balance cost effectivity of attack vs. defence on larger games.

Mod was made 2-3 years ago. It is released now.
Named same as Combined Arms in Mods in Stardrive to prevent all conflicts with BlackBox Dev Mode.

More in Depth:

--> Hull sizes have vastly reduced technology cost. Reason: there is a big number of anti capital weapons in CA and fighters can be made very good with decent speed.
--> Technology upgrade path redone. For example: Phased ordnance - shield penetration tech is now 5-25% scaling 5 levels available at start. AI works with these changes according to the AI Tech Planner.
--> Shields radius reduced by 20% and starting technologies cost increased.
--> Capital city and outposts + small flat research.
--> Various balance changes of techs, solar panels, 2x1 engine, Missiles. -> MRM are now target everything and LRM are now target all except Fighters. ATCSM no longer armor pen. Descriptions updated.
--> Torpedoes and heavy missiles reduced turn rate.
--> Regular Ordnance storage, supply and assembler causes small explosion upon destruction. Nano and armored is unaffected. Explosion is small with low damage and definitely not realistic. 
--> All Sensors ranges are greater.
--> Spaceports have 1 fighter slot simulating militia or police force.
--> Research stations approx. +50% research.
--> Solar panels rebalance, green lasers require more power, new ATCSM adv. missiles.
--> Orbital weapons rebalanced, renamed and equippable by ships.
--> Military Outposts and bases stronger defence. Home defence squadrons stronger.
--> Default gravity well range vastly increased. This is reduced for defender by home subspace projection area but affects enemies much more. Result is attacking is less overwhelmingly effective compared to defence in larger games because defender has more time to react. 
--> Drones got always shields and better shields simulating their superior evasion chance.
--> More hulls available. A typical race has access to 1-2 designs of other races. 
For example: Fighter Tech 1 unlocks Wolffish and Drone01 for Vulfars in addition to Type Ia.
Ralyehs are excluded because their devotion. Pollops have fewer hulls because pacifists.

Known Issues: Phased Ordnance tech can have wrong % displayed in tooltip. Phased ordnance is 5% shieldPen per level of tech. RU localization on changed descriptions not included.
